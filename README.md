# Wine-Alcohol-Prediction-ML
Quick Abstract: Using PyCaret on the UCI Wine dataset, this study predicts red wine alcohol content. Comparing 20+ regression models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) performed best (R2: 0.77, RMSE: 0.50). Analysis identified density and quality as the strongest predictors, validating ML for chemical estimation.
